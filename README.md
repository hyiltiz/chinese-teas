# Chinese Top Ten Teas

I looked up the classification of each of the "top ten" teas. The tea names are color coded with
their respective tea class.

## Classification

Chiense teas are classified based on production sites and the production methods.
A tea name usually starts with its production site, followed by its name used
by the locals at that site. Based on the production method, a Chinese tea can be classified
into the following classes:

- 绿茶(Green)
- 红茶(Red)
- 黑茶(Black)
- 乌龙茶(Oloong)
- 黄茶(Yellow)
- 白茶(White)
- 花茶(Flower)
- 普洱茶(Puer)


## Evaluation

According to the data from [a Chinese (Baidu) wiki page][1], Top ten teas were selected by several media sources including New York Times (2001), Hong Kong Wen Wei Po 2002, and during Panama–Pacific International Exposition (1915), China Top Ten Tea Evaluation Contest (1959).
